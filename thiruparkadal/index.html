      <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> A divine ocean where Lord Vishnu rests, and where gods and demons churned for nectar of immortality.</p>
      <p><strong>Source:</strong> Hindu mythology (Puranas, especially Vishnu Purana & Bhagavata Purana)</p>
      <h2>What it means</h2>
      <p>Thiruparkadal (literally “Sacred Milky Ocean”) is the mythological ocean of milk, said to lie beyond the material world. Lord Vishnu is believed to rest here on the serpent Adisesha, watching over the universe in eternal calm. It is also the site of the legendary Samudra Manthan (Churning of the Ocean).</p>
      <h2>The Story</h2>
      <p>The gods (devas) and demons (asuras) once churned the Thiruparkadal using Mount Mandara as the churning rod and the serpent Vasuki as the rope. From the churning emerged many treasures, including the divine cow Kamadhenu, the wish-granting Kalpavriksha tree, and finally Amrit, the nectar of immortality. Lord Vishnu played a key role in ensuring the devas gained the nectar, preserving balance in the universe.</p>
      <h2>Modern Connection</h2>
      <p>The imagery of Thiruparkadal is central to temple art and paintings, where Vishnu is depicted reclining gracefully on Adisesha amidst the Milky Ocean. Festivals and discourses often retell the Samudra Manthan, and modern films and TV serials on mythology frequently recreate the dramatic scene of gods and demons churning the cosmic ocean.</p>
