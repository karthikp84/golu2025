      <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> A pilgrimage where devotees carry decorated offerings (kavadi) to Lord Muruga’s temple at Palani, showing faith, sacrifice, and devotion.</p>
      <p><strong>Source:</strong> Tamil tradition, Murugan worship practices</p>
      <h2>What it means</h2>
      <p>Palani (Pazhani) is one of the six holy abodes (Ārūpadai Veedu) of Lord Muruga. Here, he is worshipped as a renunciate, standing with only a loincloth and staff. The kavadi — a decorated wooden structure carried on the shoulders — represents the burden of human ego and the offering of one’s self in devotion.</p>
      <h2>The Story</h2>
      <p>According to legend, Sage Narada once presented a divine fruit to Shiva and Parvati, which was to be given to their most deserving son. While Ganesha won it by circling his parents with love, Muruga left in anger and chose Palani Hill as his abode. Devotees, moved by his renunciation, began to show their love by carrying offerings up the hill. Over time, this became the tradition of the kavadi, carried with songs, fasting, and prayers. Today, the Pazhani Malai Kavadi is a vibrant festival and pilgrimage, symbolizing humility, surrender, and the joy of reaching God through devotion and discipline.</p>
      <h2>Modern Connection</h2>
      <p>The Palani Kavadi festival draws lakhs of devotees every year, making it one of Tamil Nadu’s largest pilgrimages. The kavadi has also entered popular imagery — from Tamil cinema songs to vibrant processions seen worldwide in Murugan temples, including in Singapore, Malaysia, and Sri Lanka.</p>
