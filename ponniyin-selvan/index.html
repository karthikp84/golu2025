      <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> A famous Tamil epic about Prince Arulmozhi Varman (later Raja Raja Chola), recently retold in a blockbuster two-part movie.</p>
      <p><strong>Source:</strong> Tamil historical novel by Kalki Krishnamurthy (20th century), based on real Chola dynasty events (10th century CE)</p>
      <h2>Who he is</h2>
      <p>Ponniyin Selvan means “Son of the River Ponni (Kaveri).” It refers to Arulmozhi Varman, a Chola prince who later became the great emperor Raja Raja Chola I. The novel <em>Ponniyin Selvan</em> by Kalki is one of Tamil literature’s most loved works, mixing history, romance, intrigue, and heroism.</p>
      <h2>The Story</h2>
      <p>The tale follows Vandiyathevan, a brave young warrior, as he carries secret messages across the Chola kingdom. Along the way, he meets Arulmozhi Varman (the hero), Princess Kundavai, and the mysterious Nandini — characters caught in a web of palace conspiracies. At its heart, the story shows how Arulmozhi Varman overcomes challenges, earns the love of his people, and eventually rises as one of the greatest Chola rulers, Raja Raja Chola.</p>
      <h2>Modern Connection</h2>
      <p>This timeless story was recently brought to life as a two-part Tamil movie (<em>Ponniyin Selvan I & II</em>, 2022–2023), directed by Mani Ratnam. With grand visuals, music by A.R. Rahman, and a star-studded cast, it introduced the Chola legend to a global audience — making history and heritage feel alive on the big screen.</p>
