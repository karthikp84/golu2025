      <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Lord Vishnu’s Vamana avatar, who grew into a giant (Trivikrama) and covered all the worlds in just three steps.</p>
      <p><strong>Source:</strong> Hindu mythology (Bhagavata Purana, Vishnu Purana, Vamana Avatar story)</p>
      <h2>What it means</h2>
      <p>Ulagalanda Perumal means “The Lord who measured the worlds.” It refers to Lord Vishnu’s fifth avatar, Vamana, who appeared as a humble dwarf Brahmin but transformed into the giant Trivikrama to restore cosmic balance.</p>
      <h2>The Story</h2>
      <p>The asura king Mahabali was generous but grew too powerful. Vishnu took the form of a small Brahmin boy, Vamana, and asked Mahabali for just three steps of land. Mahabali agreed. Vamana suddenly grew into a colossal form — Trivikrama — and with two steps, he covered the earth and the heavens. For the third step, the noble Mahabali offered his own head, upon which Vishnu gently placed his foot, sending him to the underworld but granting him eternal glory as a just ruler.</p>
      <h2>Modern Connection</h2>
      <p>The image of Ulagalanda Perumal — Vishnu with one foot on the earth and the other stretched to the sky — is a powerful symbol in temple art across Tamil Nadu, especially in Kanchipuram’s Ulagalantha Perumal Temple. The story is celebrated during festivals like Onam in Kerala, where Mahabali’s return is joyfully welcomed each year. It continues to inspire paintings, dance dramas, and even modern retellings in films and television.</p>
