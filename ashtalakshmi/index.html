      <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Eight different forms of Goddess Lakshmi, each blessing life with wealth, knowledge, courage, family, and more.</p>
      <p><strong>Source:</strong> Hindu mythology (Puranas, temple traditions, especially South India)</p>
      <h2>Who they are</h2>
      <p>Aṣṭalakṣmī represents the eight aspects of Goddess Lakshmi, the deity of prosperity. Each form gives a unique kind of abundance — not just money, but also knowledge, strength, family, and success. They are often worshipped together to remind us that true wealth is multi-dimensional.</p>
      <h2>The Eight Lakshmis and Their Blessings</h2>
      <ul><li><strong>Ādi Lakshmi</strong> – The primal mother, source of all wealth</li><li><strong>Dhānya Lakshmi</strong> – Grains, food, and nourishment</li><li><strong>Dhairya (Veera) Lakshmi</strong> – Courage and valor</li><li><strong>Gaja Lakshmi</strong> – Power, prosperity, and royalty (with elephants)</li><li><strong>Santāna Lakshmi</strong> – Children and family continuity</li><li><strong>Vijaya Lakshmi</strong> – Victory and success</li><li><strong>Vidya Lakshmi</strong> – Knowledge, wisdom, and learning</li><li><strong>Dhana Lakshmi</strong> – Material wealth and abundance</li></ul>
      <h2>The Story</h2>
      <p>In different legends, Goddess Lakshmi appears in these eight forms to bless the world with every type of prosperity needed for a happy life. For example, when churning the cosmic ocean (Samudra Manthan), she emerged as Ādi Lakshmi, the eternal goddess of fortune. In other stories, kings and devotees prayed to specific Lakshmis for what they lacked — food, courage, children, or wisdom. Together, the Aṣṭalakṣmī remind us that true prosperity is not only riches but also health, knowledge, strength, and family harmony.</p>
      <h2>Modern Connection</h2>
      <p>In Chennai, the famous Ashtalakshmi Temple at Besant Nagar is dedicated to all eight forms of the goddess in one place. The concept of Aṣṭalakṣmī has also been popularized through devotional songs and festivals, reminding people that wealth is more than money — it’s food, courage, knowledge, and family too.</p>
