      <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Seven powerful mother goddesses who helped Goddess Durga defeat a demon that multiplied from every drop of his blood.</p>
      <p><strong>Source:</strong> Hindu mythology (Devi Mahatmya, Puranas, local traditions)</p>
      <h2>Who they are</h2>
      <p>The Saptamātās (Seven Mothers) are a group of goddesses who represent protective motherly energy. They are worshipped together and are believed to safeguard communities, children, and families. Each Mother reflects the power of a male deity, showing how divine feminine energy balances and completes the masculine.</p>
      <h2>The Seven Mothers and Their Powers</h2>
      <ul><li><strong>Brahmāṇī</strong> – Wisdom</li><li><strong>Māheśvarī</strong> – Strength of Shiva</li><li><strong>Kaumārī</strong> – Valor of Skanda (Kartikeya)</li><li><strong>Vaiṣṇavī</strong> – Protection of Vishnu</li><li><strong>Vārāhī</strong> – Courage of Varaha (boar form)</li><li><strong>Indrāṇī</strong> – Authority of Indra</li><li><strong>Cāmuṇḍā</strong> – Fierce destroyer of evil</li></ul>
      <h2>The Story</h2>
      <p>When the demon Raktabīja battled the gods, every drop of his blood created another demon. Goddess Durga called upon the Seven Mothers to help. Together, they caught and drank the blood before it touched the ground, stopping his army and destroying him. Since then, the Seven Mothers are remembered as fierce protectors and nurturing forces — proof that motherhood can be both gentle and immensely powerful.</p>
      <h2>Modern Connection</h2>
      <p>The Saptamātās are still worshipped in many village temples across India, especially during Navratri. In dance-dramas and folk performances, they appear as fierce yet protective mothers — showing that even today, people honor them as guardians of health, family, and community.</p>
