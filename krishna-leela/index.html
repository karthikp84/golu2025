      <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Stories of Lord Krishna’s miracles and mischief — from his birth in a prison to his dances, battles, and love with the Gopikas.</p>
      <p><strong>Source:</strong> Hindu mythology (Bhagavata Purana, Harivamsa, folklore)</p>
      <h2>What it means</h2>
      <p>Leela means “divine play.” Krishna’s life is described not just as heroic acts but as playful, magical stories filled with lessons of love, devotion, and joy.</p>
      <h2>Krishna’s Birth in the Jail</h2>
      <p>Krishna was born to Devaki and Vasudeva in Mathura, where his wicked uncle Kamsa imprisoned them. On the night of his birth, miracles happened: the guards slept, the chains broke, and Vasudeva carried baby Krishna across the Yamuna River to safety in Gokul, where he was raised by Yashoda.</p>
      <h2>Krishna with the Gopikas</h2>
      <p>As a child in Gokul, Krishna charmed the village girls (Gopikas). He loved stealing butter and teasing them, yet the Gopikas adored him. Their playful bond with Krishna symbolizes pure love and devotion, where the heart longs only for God.</p>
      <h2>Rasa Leelai</h2>
      <p>On moonlit nights, Krishna danced with the Gopikas on the banks of the Yamuna. Miraculously, he multiplied himself so every Gopika felt he was dancing only with her. This Rasa Leela is celebrated as the highest expression of divine love and joy.</p>
      <h2>Kalinga Nardhanam</h2>
      <p>When the poisonous serpent Kalinga polluted the Yamuna, young Krishna leapt into the waters, fought bravely, and danced on its many hoods until it surrendered. This story shows Krishna’s courage and his power to protect nature and people from evil.</p>
      <h2>Modern Connection</h2>
      <p>Krishna Leelas are celebrated across India through classical dance (Bharatanatyam, Odissi, Kathak), colorful festivals like Janmashtami and Rasa Purnima, and even in modern films and TV serials. From temple murals to popular songs, Krishna’s playful and divine stories remain timeless, enchanting audiences young and old.</p>
