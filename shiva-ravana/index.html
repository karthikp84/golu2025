      <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> When Ravana tried to lift Mount Kailash, Lord Shiva pressed him down with a single toe, humbling his pride.</p>
      <p><strong>Source:</strong> Hindu mythology (Shiva Purana, regional retellings)</p>
      <h2>What it means</h2>
      <p>This story highlights the cosmic power of Lord Shiva and the humbling of Ravana, the mighty demon king of Lanka. It is often depicted in sculptures and golu sets as a reminder that pride, however great, must bow before divine strength.</p>
      <h2>The Story</h2>
      <p>Ravana, a great devotee of Shiva but also proud of his strength, once tried to lift Mount Kailash, Shiva’s abode, to show his might. Amused, Lord Shiva simply pressed the mountain down with his toe, trapping Ravana beneath. Realizing his folly, Ravana sang hymns in praise of Shiva (the famous Shiva Tandava Stotram) until the Lord forgave him and released him.</p>
      <h2>Modern Connection</h2>
      <p>This episode is a favorite in temple carvings and dance dramas, especially in South India, where Ravana is both feared and admired as a scholar and devotee. In modern culture, it is often retold to show how arrogance can be subdued by humility — a theme that appears in classical music, Bharatanatyam pieces, and even contemporary plays and films referencing Ravana’s devotion to Shiva.</p>
